# 👋 Hey, I'm Leandro Atochkin

### 🧠 Developer | Builder | Problem Solver

I'm a software developer who loves turning messy, real-world problems into clean, functional code. Whether it's managing massive event teams or bridging frontend apps with local file-based systems, I'm always looking for that sweet spot between simplicity and impact.

## 💡 What I’m About

- 🧱 **Full-stack mindset:** I’m equally at home building intuitive UIs or optimizing backend flows.
- 🔁 **Always learning:** Currently diving deep into event-driven systems, scalable architectures, and expressive frontends (Next.js, Astro).
- ⚙️ **Problem-first approach:** I build tools that solve *actual* problems — like syncing apps with local software or coordinating large field operations.


## 🧰 Tech Stack

**Languages:** JavaScript, SQL, Typescript  
**Frameworks:** Node.js, Express, React (learning Astro & Next.js)  
**Tools:** Git, VS Code, Postman  
**Others:** File system integrations, REST APIs, AWS Lambda, Supabase, Socket.IO

> 💡 *Fun fact:* I enjoy building software that feels invisible — the kind that just works quietly in the background, solving real-world headaches.
