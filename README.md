# 👋 Hey, I'm Leandro Atochkin

### 🧠 Developer | Builder | Problem Solver

I'm a software developer who loves turning messy, real-world problems into clean, functional code. Whether it's managing massive event teams or bridging frontend apps with local file-based systems, I'm always looking for that sweet spot between simplicity and impact.

---

## 💡 What I’m About

- 🧱 **Full-stack mindset:** I’m equally at home building intuitive UIs or optimizing backend flows.
- 🔁 **Always learning:** Currently diving deep into event-driven systems, scalable architectures, and expressive frontends (Next.js, Astro).
- ⚙️ **Problem-first approach:** I build tools that solve *actual* problems — like syncing apps with local software or coordinating large field operations.

## 🔭 Current Projects

### 🛠️ Massive Event Management App (WIP)
A platform to coordinate large-scale events with:
- Structured team roles & leaders
- Group task assignments & subtasks
- Schedules with deadline-based notifications
- Manager dashboard for full visibility

**Tech Stack:** React Native + Expo | Node.js | MySQL  
➡️ _Future roadmap includes:_ a property marketplace & a tenant-facing client app

---

### 🔌 Malbec
A system for syncing web apps with client-side software via **file-based communication** (e.g., `GO_STFIN.txt`) — useful where network reliability is limited.

**Use case:** The user places orders through a frontend that writes data to a file consumed by local software.

**Tech Stack:** Node.js | File I/O | Local Networking | Express

---

### ☁️ Serverless Backend (AWS Lambda + RDS)
Deploying Node/Express backend using `aws-serverless-express`, with a focus on low-cost scalability:
- Supabase Storage for file uploads
- API Gateway & Lambda with CORS handling
- MySQL on Amazon RDS

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

**Languages:** JavaScript, SQL  
**Frameworks:** Node.js, Express, React (learning Astro & Next.js)  
**Tools:** Git, VS Code, Postman  
**Others:** File system integrations, REST APIs, AWS Lambda, Supabase, Socket.IO

> 💡 *Fun fact:* I enjoy building software that feels invisible — the kind that just works quietly in the background, solving real-world headaches.
